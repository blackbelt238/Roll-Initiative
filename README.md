# Roll-Initiative (0.4.0)
The initiative roller is a tool created to aid DMs in keeping track of combat. When the user clicks the **Roll** button, the tool rolls initiative for each character that has been added to the table. The characters are ordered from highest initiative roll to lowest; ties are broken with the flip of a coin.
