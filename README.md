# Roll-Initiative (0.8.3)
The initiative roller is a system-agnostic tool created to aid GMs in keeping track of combat.

### Roll
The tool rolls initiative for each character that has been added to the table. Characters are ordered from highest initiative roll to lowest Any ties are broken with the flip of a coin.

### Add Characters
Clicking the plus at the top right of the table reveals a prompt into which new character info can be entered. A new character can be specified as a player character, and its initiative will default to 0.

### Edit Characters
Certain fields of a character can be edited by simply clicking the table cell associated with the field and making a change. These changes are automatically saved when focus is shifted from the cell. If an invalid value is provided, the offending cell is highlighted in red, and the change is not saved.

### Remove Characters
A character can be removed from the table by clicking the trash icon associated with that row. The tool also allows removing all NPCs from the table without clearing the player characters by clicking **Clear NPCs**. (*NOTE*: To wipe the table entirely, click the site name in the top left or refresh the page.)
